# simple-connect4-AI-game
The goal of this project is to implement a Connect 4 game using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. We design an appropriate Connect 4 board evaluation function to be used as the algorithmâ€™s utility function. Our game should allow a human player to play against our algorithm. The algorithm should use a depth-first strategy when exploring the game tree to ensure efficient memory usage.
